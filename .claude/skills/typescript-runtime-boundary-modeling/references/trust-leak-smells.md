# Trust Leak Smells

Treat these as red flags, not harmless cleanup items.

| Smell                                    | Why it leaks trust                               | Better move                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `as any` or `as unknown as T` near input | bypasses runtime proof entirely                  | parse or narrow before exporting `T`             |
| postfix `!` on boundary data             | removes `null` or `undefined` without proof      | branch, default, or reject explicitly            |
| truthiness check for boundary presence   | drops valid empty values like `0` or `""`        | check `undefined`, `null`, or exact predicates   |
| top-level object check only              | nested fields stay unproven                      | validate the full relied-on surface              |
| unstated extra-key behavior              | trusted output silently includes or drops fields | state reject, strip, or passthrough explicitly   |
| transforms scattered after parsing       | trust and normalization become hard to review    | centralize normalize logic in the boundary layer |
| DTO or record types imported into core   | raw transport or storage shape looks trusted     | map to a trusted internal shape first            |
| `process.env` read everywhere            | config trust boundary becomes invisible          | parse once in a config module                    |
| SDK or cache helpers returning `any`     | unsafe data crosses layers invisibly             | wrap with `unknown` plus boundary parser         |

## Fast rejection test

If you can no longer answer "what exact fields are trusted here and why?" the
boundary is probably leaking.
